They made the following changes:

* Thickened the overall body by 3mm
* Switched from using the plastic alignment ‘bumps’ to using 3mm stainless alignment pins
* Adjusted the position of the alignment pins
* Adjusted the filament through hole to 3mm dia.
* Printed in PCPBT

Please note it is still under development. Any questions please use the Duet3D forum: https://forum.duet3d.com/category/17/filament-monitor
